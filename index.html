          <h2>Art Block</h2>
          <p>
            I'm sure we all know the feeling, when you want to draw something, but can't really get the ideas flowing. I
            know I've been there quite a few times during my illustration career. It can be quite troublesome,
            especially if you have to design products or have commission deadlines to meet. Taking a break and looking
            for inspiration is always a good way to get over art block. Sometimes drawing something different can also
            help inspire artists and help with their art block.
          </p>
          <h2>Art Prompts</h2>
          <p>Art prompts are a great way to get inspired, and there are many types of art prompts online. Artist can
            find them throughout social media. Many prompts online often follow a theme or use words to inspire artist
            to create artwork. Those who participate often use hashtags to share their artwork with others. This is also
            a good way for artists to gain inspiration from others in the community. An example of a very popular art
            prompt is Inktober, which is a prompt released every year during the month of October. It has artists
            creaking ink illustrations and sharing them online with others. There are many other prompts released during
            this time that are inspired by the same idea. Creating art using a prompt and sharing them with others is a
            great way to be creative and find inspiration to combat your art block.

          <h2>Draw This In Your Style Challenges</h2>
          <p>
            Draw this in your style challenges (or abbreviated to DTIYS), as the tiles implies, requires you to redraw a
            piece of artwork in your own art style. It is an art challenge that many artist participate in and is a fun
            way to get inspiration, and try out drawing different content. Reimagining a piece of work in your own style
            is a good drawing exercise, and can help with finding inspiration for future artworks.
